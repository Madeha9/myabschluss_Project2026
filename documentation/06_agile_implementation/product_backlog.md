# Product Backlog

## Overview
This document contains the product backlog - the prioritized list of features, enhancements, and fixes for the product.

## Product Vision
The vision of this product is to reduce the reliance on paper invoices by providing a secure and user-friendly
digital invoice system. Customers can store and manage their purchase invoices digitally,  ensuring they are always 
available for returns or exchanges even if the paper receipt is lost or damaged. In addition, the system aims to support
customers during the shopping experience through an AI-based assistant that provides product suggestions for clothing and
shoes, such as color and style matching. The system also enables users to analyze their monthly shopping activity and
document their experiences across different physical retail stores.
